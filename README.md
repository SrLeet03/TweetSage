# TweetSage: AI-Powered Twitter Engagement Bot

## Project Description

TweetSage is a sophisticated Twitter automation tool that leverages artificial intelligence to create engaging, human-like content on Twitter. Unlike traditional bots that post generic, repetitive content, TweetSage generates contextually relevant tweets with natural language, appropriate hashtags, and engaging follow-up comments that form meaningful conversations.

The bot can automatically identify trending AI topics or accept custom topics from users, then craft professional yet conversational tweets complete with relevant links to articles or research papers. Each tweet is followed by 1-3 thoughtful comments posted as replies, creating a thread that encourages user engagement and discussion.

## Key Features

- **AI-Generated Content**: Uses OpenAI's GPT-4 to generate high-quality, contextually relevant tweets and comments
- **Topic Flexibility**: Can post about trending AI topics or custom user-defined topics
- **Natural Engagement**: Creates conversation threads with 1-3 follow-up comments per tweet
- **Human-Like Posting Patterns**: Adds random delays between comments to mimic natural human behavior
- **Smart Link Integration**: Includes relevant links with natural call-to-action phrases
- **Robust Error Handling**: Includes fallback mechanisms for all potential failure points
- **Character Limit Management**: Ensures all content stays within Twitter's limits

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language
- **Tweepy**: Twitter API client for Python
- **OpenAI API**: Leverages GPT-4 for content generation
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for monitoring and debugging
- **Environment Variables**: Secure credential management
- **Random Module**: Creates natural variation in posting patterns
- **Exception Handling**: Robust error management

## How It Works

1. **Topic Selection**: Either selects a trending AI topic or accepts a custom topic from the user
2. **Content Generation**: Sends a detailed prompt to OpenAI's GPT-4 model requesting a tweet, relevant link, and 1-3 follow-up comments
3. **Response Parsing**: Extracts and validates the tweet, link, and comments from the AI response
4. **Tweet Formatting**: Ensures the tweet is properly formatted with a natural call-to-action before the link
5. **Posting**: Posts the initial tweet using Twitter's API
6. **Comment Thread**: Posts each follow-up comment as a reply to the original tweet, with natural time delays between posts
